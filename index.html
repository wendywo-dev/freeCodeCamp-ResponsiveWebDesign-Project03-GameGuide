            Charms Class is the third main quest within Hogwarts Legacy; where

            Accio.

        <article>
          <p>
            Defense Against the Dark Arts Class is the fourth main quest within
            Hogwarts Legacy; where you continue your training on your first day
            by learning the Levioso spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            After tracking Defense Against the Dark Arts Class, head to the
            Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom. Once you enter and begin
            the lesson, you’ll meet Professor Hecat, Sebastian Sallow, and
            Leander Prewett. Here you will learn Levioso, completing the same
            spell-learning minigame as before. Hecat will then instruct you to
            perform the same on the dummy. Use a Basic Cast, then use Levioso
            (to break the Yellow shield), followed by a Basic Cast to complete
            the tutorial.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will then begin a duel against Sebastian Sallow, the first one
            in the game. Here you can use Basic Cast, Levioso, and Protego (and
            the Stupefy counter-attack). Win or lose the duel, Hecat will
            congratulate you on your effort, and you’ll then need to speak to
            Sebastian. He’ll inform you of a secret dueling club, led by Lucan
            Brattleby near the Clocktower.

        <article>
          <p>
            Weasley After Class is the fifth main quest within Hogwarts Legacy;
            where you prepare to depart for Hogsmeade, but not before learning a
            new spell, Reparo, whilst completing additional assignments from
            Professor Ronen.
          </p>
          <code>Meet Professor Weasley</code>
          <p>
            Head to the Transfiguration classroom to begin, where you will be
            introduced to the House Elf, Deek. Professor Weasley will discuss
            the additional assignments that Professors will give to you to help
            you catch up to other students, as well as discuss the imminent trip
            to Hogsmeade to refresh your supplies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Professor Weasley suggests traveling to Hogsmeade with a fellow
            student, and you get to choose between Natsai Onai and Sebastian
            Sallow. Whomever you choose, you are informed to speak with
            Professor Ronen about an additional assignment.
          </p>
          <code>Professor Ronen’s Assignment - Learn Reparo</code>
          <p>
            Report to Professor Ronen in the courtyard outside, and he’ll set
            you some tasks prior to learning Reparo. The first is as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Collect the flying page near the broken statue</li>
            <li>
              Collect the flying page in the Defense Against the Dark Arts Tower
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can collect these pages by looking at them as they fly around
            and casting Accio. Track their general location using the mini-map,
            then keep your eyes up to see a book flapping around in the air
            within that general area. With them both collected, return to Ronen
            and you’ll need to complete the spell-learning minigame as before,
            this time in the shape of a spiral.

        <article>
          <p>
            Welcome to Hogsmeade is the sixth main quest within Hogwarts Legacy;
            where you venture into Hogsmeade for the first time, restocking on
            supplies, before fending off a surprise attack from deadly enemies.
          </p>
          <code>Departing for Hogsmeade</code>
          <p>
            After choosing your traveling companion to go to Hogsmeade with,
            meet either Natsai or Sebastian at their respective locations.
            Follow them outside and then out of Hogwarts grounds, down the road
            towards Hogsmeade. They will point out bushes of Lacewing flies on
            the way that you can collect for potion-making if you wish.
          </p>
          <code>Tomes and Scrolls</code>
          <p>
            At the very south end of Hogsmeade, you’ll find Tomes and Scrolls.
            Head inside and speak to Thomas Brown. After a short conversation,
            you can purchase the Potting Table with a Small Pot and the Small
            Potions Station Spellcrafts for free.
          </p>
          <code>Ollivanders</code>
          <p>
            Just opposite The Three Broomsticks in the center of Hogsmeade,
            you’ll find Ollivanders. Head inside and use the bell on the counter
            to speak with Gerbold Ollivander. After a failed attempt or two, a
            wand reveals itself. Here you can customize your wand to your
            liking, and once completed you and the wand will synchronize
            perfectly.
